# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Overview

The RSA Factoring Challenge is a cryptographic challenge that focuses on the difficulty of factoring large semiprime numbers generated using the RSA algorithm. The challenge is a demonstration of the security of the RSA encryption scheme, which relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

## Background

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that enables secure data transmission and digital signatures. The security of RSA is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, known as the modulus.

The RSA Factoring Challenge was initiated to encourage research and development in the field of integer factorization and to assess the strength of RSA-based encryption in practice. The challenge involves the factorization of semiprime numbers of increasing difficulty.

## How to Participate

To participate in the RSA Factoring Challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Download Challenge Files:** Obtain the challenge files containing the semiprime numbers to be factored. These files are typically provided by the organizers of the challenge.

2. **Select an Algorithm:** Choose an integer factorization algorithm to attempt the factorization. Common algorithms include the Quadratic Sieve, General Number Field Sieve (GNFS), and Elliptic Curve Factorization.

3. **Implement the Algorithm:** Develop or implement the selected factorization algorithm in a programming language of your choice.

4. **Run the Algorithm:** Apply your algorithm to the challenge files and attempt to factorize the semiprime numbers.

5. **Submit Solutions:** Submit your solutions to the organizers of the RSA Factoring Challenge. Solutions are typically in the form of the prime factors of the semiprime numbers.

## Challenge Categories

The RSA Factoring Challenge typically consists of different categories with varying levels of difficulty. These categories may include:

- **Small Numbers:** Factoring smaller semiprime numbers suitable for beginners or educational purposes.

- **Standard Numbers:** Factoring larger semiprime numbers that pose a moderate level of difficulty.
